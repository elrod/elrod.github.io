  Yep, you heard it rightâ€”I turned my passion into my profession as a videogame developer.\
  Currently, I'm rocking it as TechLead and CTO at Funny Tales, an Italian video-game studio.\
  We're cooking up some cool games for Mobile, VR, and XR platforms.\
  But wait, there's more! I'm also a tech enthusiast and a bit of a researcher.\
  Back in the day, I even dipped my toes into academia as a research fellow\
  at the Computer Science department of the University of Milan, Italy.\
  I was on a mission to blend my love for gaming with cutting-edge research,\
  working on rad projects funded by the EC aimed at developing exer-games for various e-health applications.\
  This is my little corner of the web where I'm pumped to share my projects, thoughts,\
  and all things gaming! Welcome aboard!`;";
