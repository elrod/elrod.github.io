**SBK Official Mobile Game** is the official licensed game of the **FIM Superbike World Championship (WorldSBK)**, developed for **Android** and **iOS** platforms.

The game features the full **2020 and 2021 season rosters**, including official bikes, teams, and riders, allowing players to experience the thrill of superbike racing on their mobile devices.

Designed as a **free-to-play experience**, the game introduces strategic depth through **bike maintenance and performance management**:  
players must take care of their motorcycle after each event, repairing damage and performing regular servicing to ensure optimal performance.

#### Key Features

- Officially licensed WorldSBK content (2020 and 2021 seasons)
- Real-world teams, bikes, and riders across multiple championship tracks
- Realistic bike performance system affected by damage and wear
- Maintenance and upgrade mechanics integrated into the core gameplay loop
- Intuitive mobile controls with optional tilt-based steering
- Fully 3D graphics optimized for a wide range of mobile devices

#### Development Contributions

My role in the project focused on key gameplay and system components that shaped the user experience and long-term engagement:

##### Customizable Control Schemes

I designed and implemented multiple **control configurations**, allowing players to choose the driving model that best suited their playstyle.  
The goal was to maximize both **accessibility** and **fun**, offering options ranging from tilt-based steering to on-screen buttons and hybrid modes.

##### AI Tuning with Reinforcement Learning

I worked on developing a scalable and semi-automated process for **tuning AI behaviors** across different tracks and bike models.  
To do so, I adapted a **reinforcement learning framework** originally built for car AI in *Assetto Corsa Mobile*, customizing it for the unique handling and dynamics of motorcycles.  
This system helped designers iterate more effectively, generating competitive yet fair AI opponents with minimal manual tweaking.

##### In-App Purchase System & Platform Integration

I implemented the full **in-app purchase flow**, including:
- Store integration (Google Play & App Store)
- Purchase validation and error handling
- Dynamic item availability and offer management
- Real-time user profile updates to ensure consistency and persistence across sessions and devices

These components ensured a smooth monetization experience while maintaining user trust and data integrity.

#### Lessons Learned

##### Balancing Monetization and Player Engagement

One of the key takeaways from working on *SBK Official Mobile Game* was understanding the complexity of designing an effective **free-to-play business model**.

Building a game that both **monetizes successfully** and remains **engaging and respectful** to players is a constant balancing act.  
It requires careful attention to:

- **Progression pacing**, ensuring the game feels rewarding even without spending money
- **Fairness**, so that paid advantages don't alienate free users
- **Ad frequency and placement**, to avoid interrupting gameplay or creating frustration

This experience taught me how crucial it is to approach monetization **as part of the overall player experience**, rather than as an external system.  
When done right, it can enhance long-term engagement without compromising fun or fairness.
