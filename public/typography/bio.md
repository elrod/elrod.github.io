I'm Jacopo, and I'm all about videogames.
Yep, you heard it right I turned my passion into my profession as a videogame developer.

Currently, I'm rocking it as TechLead and CTO at [Funny Tales](https://funnytales.us/), an Italian video-game studio.
We're cooking up some cool games for Mobile, VR, and XR platforms.

But wait, there's more! I'm also a tech enthusiast and a bit of a researcher.
Back in the day, I even dipped my toes into academia as a research fellow
at the Computer Science department of the University of Milan, Italy.
I was on a mission to blend my love for gaming with cutting-edge research,
working on rad projects funded by the EC aimed at developing exer-games for various e-health applications.

This is my little corner of the web where I'm pumped to share my projects, thoughts,
and all things gaming! Welcome aboard!
