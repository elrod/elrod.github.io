Hi! I'm Jacopo, a passionate **videogame developer** who turned a love for gaming into a career.

At present, I’m serving as **TechLead** and **CTO** at [Funny Tales](https://funnytales.us/), an Italian game studio. We’re focused on creating engaging experiences across Mobile, VR, and XR platforms.

In addition to my work at Funny Tales, I’m also deeply interested in technology and research. I’ve worked as a research fellow in the **Computer Science** department at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/), where I contributed to European Commission-funded projects that explored the intersection of gaming and e-health, specifically through the development of exergames.

This site is my space to share my work, insights, and passion for the gaming industry. 

Thanks for stopping by!
